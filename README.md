## Password Generator

This is a basic password generator that utilizes basic javascript elements to generate and display a (somewhat) random password.

## Purpose and Criteria
The main focus of the activity was to understand how to create/edit objects and arrays, and how to utilize them in various functions. 

In this case specifically, we are using javascript functions to generate and display a password that contains some or all of the following criteria: 

* Upper Case Alphabet Characters 

* Lower Case Alphabet Characters 

* Numeric Characters

* Special Characters (e.g. @#%...)

## Expected Behavior
![The website displays a large box with the sample text "Your Secure Password" and a red button is centered below displaying the text "Generate Password"](./images/launch-page.jpg)

![After clicking the Generate Password button, the website will begin asking for the criteria upon which to generate the password. This begins with a prompt displaying that asks user to enter the number of characters desired for the password](./images/password-length.jpg)

![If a number that is not between 8 or 128 is entered, an error is displayed and the function is ended](./images/error.jpg)

![A confirmation window asks for Upper Case Characters](./images/upper-case.jpg)

![A confirmation window asks for Lower Case Characters](./images/lower-case.jpg)
